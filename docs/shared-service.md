# Shared host service

A Shuvcode host runs one managed V2 server for the interactive Shuvcode TUI and
all local or remote clients. The server owns sessions, projects, integrations,
providers, agents, plugins, MCP servers, skills, and instructions. Consumers do
not create caller-specific Shuvcode configuration domains.

## Ownership and paths

- Shuvcode owns `shuvcode.service` and its lifecycle. Host deployments persist
  `manager: "systemd"` in the channel service config so automatic CLI startup
  and explicit `shuvcode service` commands delegate to the same user unit.
- The unit defines a deterministic `PATH` containing common user package and
  tool directories. It does not depend on a desktop session importing shell
  startup state before the service starts. Its `ExecStart` leaves hostname and
  port unset so the persisted `shuvcode service set` values remain authoritative.
- The canonical Shuvcode preferences file is
  `~/.config/shuvcode/opencode.json`. Because Shuvcode intentionally retains
  OpenCode's XDG paths for compatibility, `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`
  must be a symlink to that file. Neither the unit nor an interactive shell
  sets `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR`.
- The remaining files under `~/.config/opencode` are compatibility-owned
  service registration and package data. They are not preferences sources and
  must not replace or rewrite the Shuvcode preferences symlink.
- Shuvcode's normal XDG data and state roots remain canonical for every caller.
- The channel-specific service files under `~/.config/opencode` and
  `~/.local/state/opencode` are private mode `0600`. They contain the
  administrator credential and managed-service registration used by trusted
  loopback clients. Use `shuvcode service` commands instead of selecting a file
  by name.
- Shuvcode has one shared administrator principal. Provision additional trusted
  clients out of band with the existing administrator credential and advertised
  URL metadata. Rotation is global; there is no built-in pairing flow or
  per-device revocation.

Install the user unit from this repository:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode ~/.config/shuvcode
ln -sfn "$HOME/.config/shuvcode/opencode.json" \
  "$HOME/.config/opencode/.opencode.json.shuvcode"
mv -Tf "$HOME/.config/opencode/.opencode.json.shuvcode" \
  "$HOME/.config/opencode/opencode.json"
install -m 0644 deploy/systemd/shuvcode.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user daemon-reload
shuvcode service set hostname 127.0.0.1
shuvcode service set port 4096
shuvcode service set advertised-urls https://shuvdev.tail586a6d.ts.net:10001
shuvcode service set manager systemd
systemctl --user enable --now shuvcode.service
tailscale serve --bg --https=10001 http://127.0.0.1:4096
```

The managed server binds loopback. Configure it while stopped, then publish the
separate advertised URL through the tailnet reverse proxy as shown above.

The bind and advertised URL are deliberately different. Do not widen the bind
to make a reverse-proxy URL reachable.

## Retaining session events

The CLI keeps projected sessions and the prompt inbox durable by default, but
retaining the ordered event log is a separate opt-in. Clients that need to catch
up after disconnection must enable it before collecting events:

```sh
shuvcode service set env OPENCODE_PERSIST_EVENTS true
shuvcode service start
```

Setting service configuration stops the service; start it again to apply the
change. Direct `serve --service` starts, including the systemd unit, read this
saved setting. An explicit `OPENCODE_PERSIST_EVENTS` in the server process
environment takes precedence, including `false`. For foreground and standalone
servers use `OPENCODE_PERSIST_EVENTS=true shuvcode serve` (or `serve --stdio`).
Without either setting, event retention stays disabled.

With retention enabled, the authenticated experimental endpoint
`GET /api/experimental/session/:sessionID/log?after=N&follow=false` replays
committed events after the exclusive per-session sequence `N`. Omit `after` for
all retained events; `follow=true` continues with new events. Store each event
and its sequence before advancing the consumer cursor. The `log.synced` marker
contains the captured watermark, not a delivery or execution acknowledgement.

Enabling retention does not backfill earlier events. A session that already
existed can have gaps in its retained history, and a `log.synced` marker alone
does not prove retention was enabled for the whole session. Bootstrap such
sessions from current snapshots and establish an explicit collection boundary.
Turning retention off also leaves previously retained rows intact.

Retained events include session content and accumulate in the existing database
without an automatic age limit. Protect and back up that database like the
session transcript. Deleting a session deletes its retained event history;
clients disconnected during deletion must reconcile the session's absence
instead of expecting to replay its deletion event. This option does not turn
the volatile `/api/event` feed into a replayable global log or resume model work
after process death.

## Migrating an isolated service

Stop dependent callers and back up both configuration roots. Reconcile desired
preferences into `~/.config/shuvcode/opencode.json`, then atomically point
`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` at it. Do not select an older dotfiles copy
merely because it already contains required plugins. Preserve the active
service password through `shuvcode service`, then update dependent loopback
clients to the same value without printing it. Remove any systemd drop-in that
sets `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR`, persist `manager: "systemd"` with
`shuvcode service set manager systemd`, reload the user manager, and restart
Shuvcode before its dependants.

Migrate plugins as part of the configuration merge. A V1-shaped document keeps
the singular `plugin` field because the V2 loader migrates the whole document;
a native V2 document uses `plugins`. Do not rename only that field in an
otherwise V1 document: it will be ignored during migration. Replace legacy
plugin entrypoints with their V2 server adapters and verify every required
integration method after restart.

Provider authentication stored only in a legacy credential file is not a V2
integration connection. Reconnect those providers through the V2 TUI after the
shared server is active. Do not copy credential records directly into the V2
database.

## Deploying a binary

Binary deployment must not write, replace, relink, check out, or migrate the
preferences file. On the host, deploy a clean and current `integration-v2`
checkout through the guarded installer:

```sh
./deploy/install-host.sh
```

The installer records the resolved preferences target and hash before changing
the binary and requires both to remain identical after restart. It installs and
reloads the canonical user unit before restarting the service. It also refuses
to deploy a dirty checkout, a branch other than `integration-v2`, a commit that
differs from `origin/integration-v2`, or an unsupported Bun version.
Run `./deploy/install-host.sh --check` for the same preflight without building,
installing, or restarting anything.

Treat a preferences migration as a separately reviewed operation. If the
target or hash changes during a binary deploy, abort the deploy and restore the
pre-deploy state before restarting any dependent callers.

## Verification

```sh
systemctl --user show shuvcode.service \
  -p ActiveState -p SubState -p ExecStart -p Environment
shuvcode service get manager
test "$(readlink -f ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json)" = \
  "$HOME/.config/shuvcode/opencode.json"
ss -ltnp | rg '127\.0\.0\.1:4096'
tailscale serve status
shuvcode service get
```

Verify that interactive TUI and explicitly provisioned clients see the same
session list, and that every configured V2 provider appears through the model
endpoint. For providers supplied by plugins, verify the required login methods
too; an Anthropic subscription deployment must advertise an OAuth method, not
only API-key or environment methods. Logs and verification output must not
contain administrator passwords or authorization headers.
